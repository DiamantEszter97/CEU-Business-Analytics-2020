The attached dataset consists of Margarita Pizza and Coke/Pepsi prices that are collected from all around Hungary. 

It includes 21 pizza restaurants from Budapest as well as 21 restaurants from other countries in Hungary such as Debrecen, PÃ©cs, Szeged and so on. 

The 38 distinct variables we have defined can be thought of as divided into 4 categories. The categories are:
1) "General Information" that includes columns A:H,
2) "Ratings" that includes columns I:U,
3) "Detailed Information" that includes columns V:AC, 
4) "Price Information" that includes columns AD:AL.

Due to the Pandemic, each observation has been collected via using the web and it has been recorded to a shared Microsoft Office document by the members of our group. Each member contributes by collecting data on 14 restaurants. The values have been aggregated at the end and data correction and visual improvements have been implemented where necessary.
