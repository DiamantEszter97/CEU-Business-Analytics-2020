## Chapter's database

No need to load new data, in this chapter we will use only the birdstrikes table loaded in the last chapter:

## Altering your first database

#### Copy table

```
CREATE TABLE new_birdstrikes LIKE birdstrikes;
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE new_birdstrikes;
SELECT * FROM new_birdstrikes;
```

#### Delete table

`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS new_birdstrikes;`


#### Create table

`CREATE TABLE employee (id INTEGER NOT NULL, employee_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id));`

`DESCRIBE employee;`

#### Insert new rows (records)

Insert lines in employee table one by one

```
INSERT INTO employee (id,employee_name) VALUES(1,'Student1');
INSERT INTO employee (id,employee_name) VALUES(2,'Student2');
INSERT INTO employee (id,employee_name) VALUES(3,'Student3');
```

Let's check the results

`SELECT * FROM employee;`

What happens if you try this (and why)?

`INSERT INTO employee (id,employee_name) VALUES(3,'Student4');`

#### Updating rows

`UPDATE employee SET employee_name='Arnold Schwarzenegger' WHERE id = '1';`

`UPDATE employee SET employee_name='The Other Arnold' WHERE id = '2';`

Let's check the results

`SELECT * FROM employee;`

#### Deleting rows

Deleting some records

`DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 3;`

Let's check the results

`SELECT * FROM employee`

#### Deleting rows
`TRUNCATE employee;`

Let's check the results

`SELECT * FROM employee;`

<a name="users"/>
## Users and privileges

#### Creating new user
`CREATE USER 'laszlosallo'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'laszlosallo1';`

#### Giving full rights for table employee
`GRANT ALL ON birdstrikes.employee TO 'laszlosallo'@'%';`

#### Giving rights to see one column of birdstrikes
`GRANT SELECT (state) ON birdstrikes.birdstrikes TO 'laszlosallo'@'%';`

#### Deleting user
`DROP USER 'laszlosallo'@'%';`


<br/><br/><br/>
<a name="selects"/>
## More advanced selects

#### New column
Create a new column

`SELECT *, speed/2 FROM birdstrikes;`

#### Aliasing

`SELECT *, speed/2 AS halfspeed FROM birdstrikes;`


#### Using Limit

List the first 10 records

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes LIMIT 10;`

List the first 1 record, after the the first 10

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes LIMIT 10,1;`


<br/><br/>
### `Exercise1` 
### What state figures in the 145th line of our database?
<br/><br/>


#### Ordering data

Order by a field

`SELECT state, cost FROM birdstrikes ORDER BY cost;`

Order by a multiple fields

`SELECT state, cost FROM birdstrikes ORDER BY state, cost ASC;`

Reverse ordering

`SELECT state, cost FROM birdstrikes ORDER BY cost DESC;`


<br/><br/>
### `Exercise2` 
### What is flight_date of the latest birstrike in this database?
<br/><br/>




#### Unique values 

Of a column

`SELECT DISTINCT damage FROM birdstrikes;`

Unique pairs

`SELECT DISTINCT airline, damage FROM birdstrikes;`


<br/><br/>
### `Exercise3` 
### What was the cost of the 50th most expensive damage?
<br/><br/>


#### Filtering
Select the lines where states is Alabama

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE state = 'Alabama';`

## Comparison Operators

![Data types](/SQL2/ops.png)



<br/><br/><br/>
<a name="VARCHAR"/>
## Filtering with VARCHAR

#### NOT EQUAL

Select the lines where states is not Alabama

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE state != 'Alabama'`

States starting with 'A'

#### LIKE

`SELECT DISTINCT state FROM birdstrikes WHERE state LIKE 'A%';`

Note the case (in)sensitivity

`SELECT DISTINCT state FROM birdstrikes WHERE state LIKE 'a%';`

States starting with 'ala'

`SELECT DISTINCT state FROM birdstrikes WHERE state LIKE 'ala%';`

States starting with 'North ' followed by any character, followed by an 'a', followed by anything

`SELECT DISTINCT state FROM birdstrikes WHERE state LIKE 'North _a%';`

States not starting with 'A'

`SELECT DISTINCT state FROM birdstrikes WHERE state NOT LIKE 'a%' ORDER BY state;`


#### Logical operators

Filter by multiple conditions

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE state = 'Alabama' AND bird_size = 'Small';`

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE state = 'Alabama' OR state = 'Missouri';`

#### IS NOT NULL

Filtering out nulls and empty strings

`SELECT DISTINCT(state) FROM birdstrikes WHERE state IS NOT NULL AND state != '' ORDER BY state;`

#### IN

What if I need 'Alabama', 'Missouri','New York','Alaska'? Should we concatenate 4 AND filters?

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE state IN ('Alabama', 'Missouri','New York','Alaska');`

#### LENGTH
Listing states with 5 characters

`SELECT DISTINCT(state) FROM birdstrikes WHERE LENGTH(state) = 5;`


<br/><br/><br/>
<a name="INT"/>
## Filtering with INT

Speed equals 350

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE speed = 350;`

Speed equal or more than 25000

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE speed >= 10000;`

#### ROUND, SQRT

`SELECT ROUND(SQRT(speed/2) * 10) AS synthetic_speed FROM birdstrikes;`

#### BETWEEN

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes where cost BETWEEN 20 AND 40;`




<br/><br/>
### `Exercise4` 
### What state figures in the 2nd record, if you filter out all records which have no state and no bird_size specified?


<br/><br/><br/>
<a name="DATE"/>
## Filtering with DATE

Date is "2000-01-02"

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE flight_date = "2000-01-02";`

All entries where flight_date is between "2000-01-01" AND "2000-01-03"

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes WHERE flight_date >= '2000-01-01' AND flight_date <= '2000-01-03';`

#### BETWEEN

`SELECT * FROM birdstrikes where flight_date BETWEEN "2000-01-01" AND "2000-01-03";`


<br/><br/>
### `Exercise5` 
### How many days elapsed between the current date and the flights happening in week 52, for incidents from Colorado? (Hint: use NOW, DATEDIFF, WEEKOFYEAR)
